In module 4, one of the most important things introduced is neural networks. While neural networks are certainly impressive in their ability to make accurate predictions, the neural network is only as good as the design the programmer desides to give it. Using the Keras library in python, it is fairly simple to add more layers to your neural network, change your optimizer, and make other changes that may either increase or decrease your model's accuracy. Like other machine learning models, there is always the risk of overfitting your training data to your neural network if you are not careful.
