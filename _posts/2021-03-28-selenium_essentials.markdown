While gathering the data for my capstone project, I ran into an initial issue. When trying to gather the relevant data from the tables on crossfit.com, I kept getting error messages due to the information in the table being updated using javascript. I used the python library, Selenium, in this project to webscrape due to its ability to handle the javascript, and interact with a website without using your mouse.
