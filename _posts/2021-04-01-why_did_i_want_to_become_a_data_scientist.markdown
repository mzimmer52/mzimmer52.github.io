When I entered my senior year of college, I was unsatisfied for the most part with my Environmental Studies major. Not only did I not have a passion to work in the Environmental Field, but I also felt as if I  hadn't developed any skillset that could give me a compeitive edge in the job marketplace. For my first semester of senior year, I decided to take a computer science course on a whim. I had taken some computer science courses in highschool, but had never really understood the things I was doing on a deeper level. After a few weeks, I began to fall in love. Not only did python come incredibly naturally to me, but I also began to develop a general passion for coding and solving complex problems. About midway through the semester, I decided it would be a good idea to enroll myself in a coding bootcamp of some sort where I could further develop this skillset at a pace beyond that of class. I eventually chose the data science bootcamp.

With a world that is becoming more data-driven everyday, the ways we manipulate and analyze data have become more important than ever. I knew this when thinking about what I wanted to study in my bootcamp. I have also always been very interested in the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning worked, and was curious to find out more/possibly make some models myself in the future.
